## 📝 Requirements

With a **Zeplin design** as the starter point, the exercise consists on developing a web-site using the following **elements**:

- **Sass**
- **Flexbox and CSS Grid**
- **Media queries**
- **Interactions with the user**

The following **requirements** have to be respected:

1. The **menu** button should have a **fixed position** and should not dissapear when scrolling. It should also contain a link to [Adalab](https://adalab.es/)'s website.
2. The **firs module** (Anonymous proxy) should be solved using **flexbox**, and it needs to occupy the height of the viewport.
3. The **second module** (Looking Through A Window) should be sholved using the **desired CSS properties**.
4. The **third module** (3 Reasons to Purchase) should be laid out using **CSS Grid** in all screen sizes.
5. The **fourth module** should be laid out using **flexbox** and all links should redirect to [Adalab](https://adalab.es/)'s website.

In total, there are several **interactions** to resolve:

1. The **arrow button** in the hero module should **link to the "3 Reasons To Purchase" section**.
2. The **footer arrow** button should link to the **top of the page**.
3. All **footer links** should go to **[Adalab](https://adalab.es/)**.
4. In the **buttons** ("Go" and "3 Reasons To Purchase") you must include a **transform** that we leave to your choice.
5. **BONUS**: 
   - make a small **animation** in the footer button.
   - make the **transform with transition**.
